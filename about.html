										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/ola.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I am an enthusiastic, energetic and passionate Data Scientist, author of 'Autonomous Self-Driving Robot for Parcel Delivery' and a graduate of Computer Science. I create successful software solutions that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. <br/> <br/>
									I have experiance in Machine Learning and Data Science but I also work on Web Design from time to time.As a person who is highly analytical, I crave facts and figures, hence I research
									a lot. From personal decisions to professional work, I research, observe,
									formulate theories and experiment. This being my greatest strength enables
									me to do even the most strenuous jobs.
									
									</p>

									<h2>My Story</h2>
									
									<p>The mystery of how a piece of metal and plastic, the computer converts
										electricity into interactable images and sounds always amazed me. I began
										exploring computers and became a self-taught programmer at age 15. I
										decided to pursue education in computer science and got an 'Intermediate in
										Computer Science' degree from a renowned college in my city with a deep
										understanding of computer fundamentals. I immidiately got into a technical university and got 'Bachelor of Computer Science' degree. <br/>
										I have been developing various personal projects ever since from android
										applications to AI software like exercise monitoring and stock forecasting etc.
										I took on impossible challenges like developing a self-driving robot at my
										university and through the journey have achieved technical skills and
										personality growth in various areas.</p>

									<h2>Clients & Companies</h2>
									<p>I have worked with High Profile Clients/ Organizations in my Career including following. <br/>
										✅ Rehmat Group of Builders <br/>
										✅ SeerBytes <br/>
										✅ Orel Vision <br/>
										✅ Androod Tech <br/>
										✅ Google I/O 
										
									</p>
									<p>Androod tech is where I started my professional carrer. I worked as an intern in that organization and learned important skills and practices in android development.
										I also learned using frameworks, development kils and environments to develop a visual application.
									</p>
									<p> During my university, I got an interview at Seerbytes for ASP .NET web development.
										But the CTO saw another potential in me that was business and marketing development. I worked there as a 
										business developer for a year part time and learned prfessionalism, management, presentation and marketting and strategy. Along with that I also worked on enterprise applications.

									</p>
									<p>
									During my final graduate year, I spiked interest in Artificial Intelligence and did my thesis & project on that.
									After graduation, I immidietly got an offer from Orel Vision to work as a ML engineer for drone tech. It was an exciting work to make CV based AI systems for drones. After my contract of two months was over, I took a break, came back home and did freelance work on Data Science and Machine Learning from home.
